The present study examined the otolith chemistry of juvenile polar cod from six oceanographic regions of the Arctic Ocean in order to document patterns of spatial segregation, dispersion and migration during the species early life. The freshwater winter refuge hypothesis, suggesting that polar cod larvae start to hatch in winter in freshwater-influenced regions but only later in the season in purely marine regions, was also tested.",

The project is now part of NCP's core monitoring program and has expanded in scope on a geographic scale, sampling strategies, and targeted contaminants. Currently, this project uses ultratrace analysis of seawater for mercury and methyl mercury species, perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), organophosphate ester flame retardants (OPE), brominated flame retardants (BFR), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), polycyclic aromatic carbons (PACs/PAH), and several other legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs). To the greatest extent possible, we partner with community members to lead sampling. The communities we work with include: Resolute Bay, Nain, and Cambridge Bay.",

Previous studies have shown that mercury and perfluorinated chemicals are carried into Arctic lakes during spring melt and are taken up and concentrated through the food web into char. This research examined food web accumulation of mercury, which has both natural and human sources and undergoes complex transformations in lakes, and of perfluorinated chemicals, which are entirely human-made, arrive solely by atmospheric deposition, and are not transformed in the environment. We built on previous research by contrasting how these two persistent contaminants concentrate through lake food webs and examining factors that affect their levels in char and other organisms in High Arctic lakes. The research focused on lakes in the Resolute Bay area (North, Small, Meretta, Resolute, 9 Mile, Char), because the arctic char and the supporting food webs of these lakes hd already been studied.",

This monitoring approach will allow us to identify components of the water supply system where contaminants could be introduced to potable water. Remediation strategies can then be developed to specifically address these issues, and therefore improve the quality and safety of water delivered to community residents.  One of the primary goals of this project was to develop local capacity for advanced water analysis. Standard operating procedures for sampling and lab analysis will be developed, and hands-on training will be provided to Nunavut Research Institute staff, to allow for future sampling of this nature. It is the intent that this initiative will lead to a longer-term monitoring program in several other Nunavut communities.",

         "description":"The project will establish a long-term community-based monitoring program for fishery-dependent data collection for Cambridge Bay Arctic Char. Educating and training local monitors and fishers will facilitate documentation of river-specific catch and effort information by and for community resource users. Total harvest removal estimates will allow managers to determine the current status of a fishery and whether the quotas support sustainable harvest levels. The data produced from catch and effort estimates can be used as a proxy for population abundance and for monitoring long term trends in the fishery. These data can be integrated into models to better predict the outcome of alternative management regimes or what effect current management approaches may have on the stock. An established time series is critical to achieve greater accuracy in the population estimates and implement improved management strategies that will ensure Arctic Char are managed in a sustainable manor. This monitoring program will occur annually at commercial waterbodies, (i.e., Ekalluk, Halovik, Lauchlan, Paliryuak, and Jayco rivers) typically spanning from early July to late September. The initial length of the project will be seven years, reflecting given that the minimum number of years needed to collect catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data is five years. This will also allow for modifications to the study design and monitoring protocol. Training and education of local monitors and fishers will benefit the community in the long-term, increasing the community's scientific knowledge of their fish resource and the framework applied for co-management decision making. The knowledge transfer and subsequent skills developed through this monitoring program will be a valuable asset which will allow Inuinuktut and other northerners to initiate and further engage in future cumulative impact monitoring programs and fish stock assessment surveys in the Canadian north.",

The project consists in the identification of indicator stock(s) for Arctic Char in the Cumberland Sound Area. The indicator stock(s) will be the focus of annual sampling and monitoring efforts during five consecutive years, including: (i) a test fishery program with progressive increase in harvest; (ii) biological sampling of fish; (iii) harvest monitoring; and (iv) monitoring of selected environmental parameters related to Arctic Char movement, habitat and fishery productivity. The project involves a platform for IQ gathering and synthesis and for knowledge co-production on Arctic Char and freshwater ecosystems from Cumberland Sound. Expected outputs include significant data development on Arctic Char, information gap-filling on the responses of Char populations to fishing pressure and selected environmental drivers, and the provision of integrated IQ-science advice for fisheries co-management of the species. Community involvement and participation is at the core of this project, which is designed to stimulate and enhance local capacity for data collection and knowledge gathering and to integrate traditional practices with scientific expertise. Long-term goals are to demonstrate the effectiveness of community-based monitoring and knowledge co-production for realizing conservation and simultaneous optimization of Arctic Char resources in Nunavut and for fostering community involvement in stock assessment and decision-making processes. The implementation and fine-tuning of a community-based fishery monitoring program/stock assessment framework for Arctic Char in Pangnirtung should facilitate future expansions to other Baffin Island communities, which is the intended scope of the project.",

         "description":"The general objective of this project was to monitor the three species of large terrestrial carnivores of Nunavut: wolverine (Gulo gulo), wolf (Canis lupus), and grizzly bear (Ursus arctos). These three species play essential functions in the terrestrial ecosystem of Nunavut and are also tightly linked with some traditional activities, skills and knowledge of the Inuit people. Wolverine, wolf and grizzly bear also represent key indicators of environmental health because their demography depends on a large prey base and is influenced by the various pressures arising from changes in both local land use and the global environment. The specific objectives of this project were: i) to analyse ecological samples and data collected in previous years of the project, ii) to enhance and pursue our community-based harvest collection program of carcasses of wolverine, wolf, and grizzly bear, and iii) to collect Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (IQ) to document trends in the abundance and distribution of these three species and to document important information on their ecology. (This project is part of a larger research program which has as main objectives to: 1) Assess large carnivores population status, distribution and spatio-temporal trends across Nunavut; 2) Better understand the role of large carnivores in the functioning of the Arctic terrestrial ecosystem and their potential implication in the recent decline of several tundra caribou herds; 3) Develop ecological indicators of environmental change using large carnivores; and 4) Develop community-based ecological monitoring through a combination of scientific methods and IQ).",

The short-term objective to achieving this was to determine hydrocarbon concentrations in 40 samples of marine sediments from sediment cores recently collected from 10 locations across the region. From each core, 4 slices were analyzed (4 slices - 1 at surface, and 3 lower down) representing different time periods from pre-industrial to present. The longer-term objective was to use hydrocarbon composition biomarkers derived from these data to establish their sources (natural seeps, terrestrial run-off, oil/gas combustion-related) in the marine ecosystem in this part of the Canadian Arctic, prior to any future oil and gas exploration in the region and prior to the likely expansion of shipping traffic through the Northwest Passage.",

The research will also examine potential cascading ecological impacts resulting from the loss of summer sea ice on marine bird populations from increased predation by polar bears. Specific study objectives include: 1) Compilation of baseline data on eider and other marine bird abundance and distributions in coastal areas, 2) Estimation of the number and proportion of nests potentially susceptible to flooding by ships wakes, 3) Identification of critical habitats for nesting and brood rearing that could be damaged by industrial accidents such as oil discharge or grounding, 4) Monitoring of polar bear activity on bird colonies and quantify the extent of bear predation of bird nests, and  5) Documenting TEK of changing relationships between polar bear, seals, and birds as they relate to sea-ice conditions and climate change.",

Collect blubber samples from seals that can be used to estimate the diets of polar bears using a technique known as fatty acid signature analysis. Polar bear fat samples will come from bears taken in the annual subsistence hunt and sampled according to current harvest regulations; 3. Build predictive models of seal population dynamics in the context of climate warming; 4. Monitor the body condition of seals; 5. Propose conservation initiatives to mitigate environmental impacts of climate warming and increased economic activities that may negatively affect seals and, to monitor their success in an adaptive management regime; 6. Work with the community of Kugaaruk to develop and implement a long-term Community-Based Monitoring (CBM) network program.",
