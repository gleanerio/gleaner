  "description": "The digital surface models, generated from sUAS-derived images and SfM methods, show fault scarps and offset channels at six sites along the oblique-slip and strike-slip segments of the Panamint Valley Fault.  The fault cuts Late Quaternary alluvial deposits. These data were collected as part of a master\u0092s thesis. The study aims to reconstruct the displacement and rupture length of the most recent earthquake, and understand the kinematics of the geometrically complex Panamint Valley Fault.",
