# Scripts

## About 

Scripts here were really out of scope for Gleaner and its mission.
They were better aligned (ie, reading and loading data)
with the Nabu program.  As such, resources that were here
can be found in the [Nabu scripts directory](https://github.com/gleanerio/gleaner/tree/master/scripts).
