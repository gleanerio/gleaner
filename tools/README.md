# Tools (Dev and Testing)

## About

This directory holds code that is for testing new ideas or code elements.  It is not
really a collection of tools, but rather a collection of code that is useful for development
support.

Much of what is in here may break and changes on made in internal to support the real tools
in the 'cmd' directory.  This directory is more for developers than end users.
